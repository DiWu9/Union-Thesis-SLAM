# Comparing the Performance of Volumetric Grids and Hash Tables for Mapping in SLAM

## Goal: 

Both volumetric grids and hash tables are used as the data structure for storing maps in SLAM. For my thesis research, I am trying to compare the running time and space efficiency of volumetric grids and hash tables in SLAM.
The example of volumetric grid is directly downloaded from [Volumetric TSDF Fusion of RGB-D Images in Python](https://github.com/andyzeng/tsdf-fusion-python). The implement of hash map is referenced from the [Voxel Hashing](https://github.com/niessner/VoxelHashing) method.
